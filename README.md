    <h2> <strong> About Me</strong> </h2>
  <p> Hi, My name is Erica, I am currently a sophmore studying Graphic Design at Lesley University, located in Cambridge Ma. I have always been a traditional artist, specialising in paints, drawing and fiberarts and I am expanding my skillset into the digital realm to pursue my interests in Graphic Design. I grew up in burlington Ma, graduated from Burlington High, and played soccer in high school, I was a goalie... I miss it a little bit. My hobbies include but are <em>not</em> limited to crochet, sewing, baking, painting and cooking.   </p>
